# Music Webapp using React and Django

#### This is a project I am working on by following **Tech with Tim** [Django & React Tutorial on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-age0BPVo&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j&pp=iAQB)

###### This is still a work in progress...

Make sure to use an virtual environment to run this project.  
To run your virtual env, you typically run this on your terminal:  
cd to your virtual environment folder then

```powershell
.\Scripts\activate
```

Then run your server to view the project by:

```powershell
python .\manage.py runserver
```

Bundle webpack by running:  
cd into frontend folder

```powershell
npm run dev
```
